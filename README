--Window Cleaning Estimator

A public release of my homebuilt window cleaning pwa.
It has helped be become rigidly consistant in my pricing. 

I count up the windows and read the customer the price. If I lose it I lose it but I produce consistant results now.
========================================

HOW TO DEPLOY:
Replace all values in variables.php marked with [BLANK]
  ---All calculations downstream of those values should work as long as your numbers make sense.
  ---The result is more complex than windows*price. It takes your overhead into account. Tweak your numbers up and down slightly to taste.
  
Use a tally app to count up the windows. I suggest using one tally per type word-for-word from the calculator in the same order so you can copy it over easily

========================================
